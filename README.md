Hello. Sorry for contacting you like this, but this was the only way I could think of to get in touch.

This GitHub user account doesn't appear active and I was wondering if you'd be willing to transfer ownership
to us. "We" are Feisty Duck (https://www.feistyduck.com), and we're looking to publish here some of our
open source materials, such as OpenSSL Cookbook and other work. If you're not using this account, it would
mean a lot to us to be able to use the same username we have on all other platforms, as well as make it
easier for others to find us.

My email address is ivanr@webkreator.com. I'd appreciate a quick yay/nay so that we know if we should use
a different username.

Much appreciated.
